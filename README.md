<h1>Price Stealer</h1>
<hr />
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually its not a big deal. It just scatters through the html code of a url, to find some data (mainly price) inside it and extract it.</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It uses a simple search and a regex for this purpose.</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though this one is designed to use Irarz index page to obtain USD price in Rials [For example], It can get other prices by specifying the id used for that inside the code.</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also it can be used to obtain data from other sites too. Though it may need some minor changes..</p>
