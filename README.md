<h1>Price Stealer</h1>
<hr />
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually its not a big deal. It just scatters through the html code of a url, to find some data (mainly price) inside it and extract it.</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It uses a simple search and a regex for this purpose.</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though this one is designed to use Irarz index page to obtain USD price in Rials [For example], It can get other prices by specifying the id used for that inside the code.</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also it can be used to obtain data from other sites too. Though it may need some minor changes..</p>

<h2>TODO: </h2>
<hr>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add an option to find the data WITHOUT specifying any parent html tag.</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design a telegram bot [using my Payagraph python package], that will get the price and send the data to the user by a specified interval.</p>
